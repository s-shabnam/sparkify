# Sparkify

Data Scientist Capstone project\

The goal of the project Sparkify is to analyze user interaction logs of the song streaming platform to predict user future actions (upgrade, downgrade, cancel their service). The done predictions may be useful for proposing more adaptive services and keep the users happy with the platform's services.

The main steps of the projects are to load, clean, explore, create features and models and predict user actions.
